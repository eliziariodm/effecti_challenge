# Developer technical assessment

This repository contains the technical assessment for developers applying to work at Effecti. The assessment consists of developing a ToDo App using Flutter.

### Objective

Develop a ToDo App that allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. The app should be developed using Flutter and follow best development practices, design patterns, including state management, unit testing, component testing, and integration testing.

### Functional requirements

| 2 | **Architecture and design patterns** | Use a well-defined architecture (e.g., MVVM, Clean Architecture) and appropriate design patterns. |
| 3 | **Data persistence**                 | Tasks should be saved locally on the device using a local database.                               |
| 4 | **Unit testing**                     | Create unit tests for business logic.                                                             |
